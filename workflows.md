# Workflows

Since YellowAnt is connected to all your apps, you can create cross application workflows that can be triggered by a YellowAnt command or a background event from one of your apps. These powerful workflows ultimately let you automate a significant chunk of your tasks and take actions with incredible speed thereby reducing your response time to critical events.

Advantages of using YellowAnt Workflows

1. **Command-triggered** - Background running workflows are awesome, but a lot of times you would also want control over when you want to perform a bunch of tasks across applications by manually feeding data or intervening the process. These scenarios are great are perfect for using Command Workflows.
2. **Event-triggered** - Let your work be automated using event-workflows. In these cases, a particular trigger in a certain app initiates different actions across applications.
3. **Enriched with logic** - Add conditions in between steps, perform relational operations and even repeat actions over a certain data set using the various functions available under YellowAnt Workflows.
4. **Data formatting** - Format data based on your requirements in the beginning, in between or towards the end of workflows.
