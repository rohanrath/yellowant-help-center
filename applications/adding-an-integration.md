# **How to Integrate an Application**

_Note: We would use Asana as an example for the comprehensive steps. You can find out how to integrate specific apps on their respective application page in the marketplace. _

1. Go to your YellowAnt Dashboard \([yoursubdomain.yellowant.com](/yoursubdomain.yellowant.com)\) or head over to the [YellowAnt Marketplace](https://www.yellowant.com/marketplace).

2. If you are in the dashboard, go to the tab called "Applications" and look for "Asana" under available applications. If you have already integrated the application, you will be able to see it under "My Applications".  
   &lt;Screen1 and Screen2&gt;

3. If you are in the Marketplace you can find Asana under various categories such as _all \_and_ project management\_. You can also search for this application in the search bar.

4. Once you find the application either in the dashboard or on the Marketplace click on view. You will be taken to a page where you'll find the integrate option/button. Click on the integrate button.

5. You will be on the integration page which prompts you to add an account to the application. Click add account which takes you to the Asana OAuth page.

6. Allow the needed permissions and Asana is now integrated with YellowAnt.
