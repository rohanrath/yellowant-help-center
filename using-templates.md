# Workflow Templates

Workflow templates are pre-made workflows that you can find in the YellowAnt Workflows Marketplace. These workflows are built by:

* YellowAnt Team: Our team is constantly churning out new templates which we feel would be useful to our users. In the marketplace, you will also find collections which are sets of useful workflows bundled together. 
* YellowAnt Users: Users of YellowAnt also build workflows and can publish it for others to use as well. When publishing the right to use them can be limited to either just their team or make it available to the entire community of YellowAnt users. 

Steps to start using an existing template:

1. Go to the Workflow Marketplace. You can either go directly from the overview panels of the dashboard or either of the workflow panels in the dashboard.
