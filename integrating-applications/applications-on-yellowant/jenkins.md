2. If you are in the dashboard, go to the tab called "Applications" and look for "Jenkins" under available applications. If you have already integrated the application, you will be able to see it under "My Applications".

3. If you are in the Marketplace you can find Jenkins under various categories such as all and project management. You can also search for this application in the search bar.

5. You will be on the integration page which prompts you to add an account to the application. Click "add account" which takes you to the Jenkins Access page.  
   Note: Select a team before you click "+ ADD ACCOUNT".  

6. In this step, YellowAnt asks you for the Jenkins User API Key.  

7. You can find the API Key for Jenkins in your account under the account button in your profile. Copy and paste that API Key in the text field on YellowAnt Integration page.  

8. Jenkins is now integrated and you get a message on your chat application for the same. You will be able to see it under your applications in the Dashboard too.
