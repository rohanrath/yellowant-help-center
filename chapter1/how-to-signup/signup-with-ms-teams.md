# Signup with Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams users can directly import the YellowAnt bot into a team by adding YellowAnt from the Teams bot marketplace. You will be asked to authorize your Azure account, after which YellowAnt will create a team account with the same domain name as your Azure email domain. If you are the first one from your Office 365 directory to integrate YellowAnt, YellowAnt will make you the owner of the YellowAnt team account.

Let's take a look at the step by step process for signing up using Slack:

1. Go to Microsoft Teams, and click on the \[**...\]** button next to your Team name in the sidebar
