# Setting up an account

YellowAnt accounts exist within teams. Every individual in the team creates their own account within the team.

For example, a member of team ACME is signing up on YellowAnt for the first time. He create a team called acme-team on YellowAnt. The URL for the team is acme-team.yellowant.com and anyone from the same team would be in the same YellowAnt team as well. This is because all YellowAnt accounts \(Basic, Premium or Enterprise\) are billed at a team level.

When signing up on YellowAnt using Slack, each member is automatically a part of the same YellowAnt team, and billing takes place under that same team.  
For example,
