# Setting up an account

YellowAnt accounts exist within teams. Every individual in the team creates their own account within the team.

For example, a member of team ACME is signing up on YellowAnt for the first time. He creates a team called acme-team on YellowAnt. The URL for the team is acme-team.yellowant.com and anyone from the same team would be in the same YellowAnt team as well. This is because all YellowAnt accounts \(Basic, Premium or Enterprise\) are billed at a team level.

The team URL looks like this:

![](/assets/teamname.png)

In a Slack team, when one of the team members signs up on YellowAnt, a new YellowAnt team with the same subdomain is created. Now, whenever a member of that Slack team joins YellowAnt, they are automatically part of the same YellowAnt team. This is because of the same reason i.e. billing takes place at a team level.

For example, the acme-team on slack has a corresponding acme-team on YellowAnt when signing up using Slack.

If Slack team URL is:

![](/assets/slackteam.png)

Then, YellowAnt team URL would be:
