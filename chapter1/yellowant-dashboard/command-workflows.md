**What is a command workflow? **YellowAnt is connected to all your apps so you can create cross application workflows that can be triggered by a YellowAnt command. This means with a simple command you can

The application panel of the YellowAnt dashboard is the control center for all your integrations.

It is divided into two sections -

**Your Applications**

This section contains all the applications that are already integrated with your YellowAnt account. The integrated applications' cards will have a button called 'Manage' which you can click to enter the settings page of that particular application.

* **Change the application invoke name**  
  The invoke name is used to call apps with commands. For example, the default invoke name for GMail is 'gmail' and to send a mail, you must execute the command 'gmail send'. If you change the invoke name from 'gmail' to 'email', the corresponding send mail command becomes 'email send'.

* **Change notifications settings**  
  YellowAnt subscribes you to a number of notification for each account of that application. If you don't wish to receive those notifications you can change them individually from here.

**Available Applications**

This section contains all the applications that are available as YellowAnt integrations. The application cards have a button called 'Integrate' which on clicking takes you to the integration page of the application.

Start integrating applications.
