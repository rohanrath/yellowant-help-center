# Manage Apps

The "Manage Apps" button takes you to the application management center for all your integrated applications. On the left panel, you can see all your integrated apps and the corresponding setting page for it. When you click on an application, you enter the settings page of that particular application. You can perform two operations from there: 

* Change the application invoke name  
  The invoke name is used to call apps with commands. For example, the default invoke name for GMail is 'gmail' and to send a mail, you must execute the command 'gmail send'. If you change the invoke name from 'gmail' to 'email', the corresponding send mail command becomes 'email send'.

* Change notifications settings  
  YellowAnt subscribes you to a number of notification for each account of that application. If you don't wish to receive those notifications you can change them individually from here.
